# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

In this project, we explore an exchange economy. First of all, we illustrate the Pareto improvements relative to the endowment and calculate the error in market clearing condition. Then, we find various allocation in the marke equilibrium given different restrictions. Finally, we find the market equilibrium allocation for 50 different elements of endowments drawn from a uniform distribution.
