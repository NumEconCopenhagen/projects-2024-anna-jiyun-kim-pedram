1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project: In the project, we have fetched data from Statistikbanekn to explore the potential correlation between education length and fertility. 
3. Model project: We model a Cournot economy and find a nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we look into the effects of expanding the economy by changing the number of firms, showing the differences between Cournot, Bertrand, monopolistic and free competition economies.
