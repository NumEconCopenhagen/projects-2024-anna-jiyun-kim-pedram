# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Why do we get fewer kids"  and aims to explore the potential correlation between education length and number of kids.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. HFUDD11 from Statistikbanken
1. INDKP106 from Statistikbanken

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``


To-Do list for us:
* Make a count for total population
* Make a var = total pop in copenhagen / people with a BA in copenhagen (for all 3 cities)
* Make a graph of people with a BA and average income
* Compare women with high education to the fertility rate
* If possible, compare higher education and fertility rates of Denmark with South Korea and/or Japan, Italy (due to historically low fertility)
