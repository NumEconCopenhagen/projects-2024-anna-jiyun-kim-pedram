# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Why do we get fewer kids"  and aims to explore the potential correlation between education length and fertility.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. HFUDD11 from Statistikbanken
2. INDKP106 from Statistikbanken
3. Fert_Data.csv from The World Bank Global Indicators for Fertility
4. sdg_04_20_page_linear.csv from Eurostat on Tertiary education levels for EU countries

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``
``pip install pandas-datareader``



**Group members:**
- Jiyun Kim
- Pedram Nick Yazdanfard
- Anna Svenningsen

Note that datatest copy.ipynb is not part of the results, but merely a notebook containing more data on EU countries.
