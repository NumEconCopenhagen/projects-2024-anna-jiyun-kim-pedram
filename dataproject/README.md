# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Why do we get fewer kids"  and aims to explore the potential correlation between education length and number of kids.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. HFUDD11 from Statistikbanken
1. INDKP106 from Statistikbanken

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
